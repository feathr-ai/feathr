# Feature Generation
User could utilize feature generation to pre-compute and materialize the pre-defined features in the feature
definition configs, to online and/or offline storage. This is a common practice when the feature transformation is 
computation intensive.

Examples:

```python
client = FeathrClient()
redisSink = RedisSink(table_name="nycTaxiDemoFeature")
# Materialize two features into a redis table.
settings = MaterializationSettings("nycTaxiMaterializationJob",
                                   sinks=[redisSink],
                                   feature_names=["f_location_avg_fare", "f_location_max_fare"])
client.materialize_features(settings)

```
If it is also possible to backfill the features for a previous time range:

```python
client = FeathrClient()

# Simulate running the materialization job every day for a time range between 2/1/22 and 2/20/22
backfill_time = BackfillTime(start=datetime(2022, 2, 1), end=datetime(2022, 2, 20), step=timedelta(days=1))
settings = MaterializationSettings("nycTaxiMaterializationJob",
                                   sinks=[redisSink],
                                   feature_names=["f_location_avg_fare", "f_location_max_fare"],
                                   backfill_time=backfill_time)
client.materialize_features(settings)
```
Alternatively, this can be done by using feature generation config and CLI:
