# Feathr Registry Access Control

A project level role based access control (RBAC) plugin is available to help you manage who have access to **Feathr Registry**.

It provides a simple authorization system built on OAuth tokens along with a SQL database as backend storage for `userrole` records.

## How Registry Access Control works?

With Registry Access Control, you can

- Share your project metadata(read-only) by assigning `consumer` role.
- Invite contributors to update features in this project by assigning `producer` role.
- Transfer project admin by assigning `admin` role.

For `admin`, `producer`, `consumer` explanation, please refer to [Role](#role) section.

### Scope

_Scope_ is the set of resources that the permission applies to. In Feathr, you can specify a scope at 2 levels: **global**, **project**. Lower levels inherit role permissions from higher levels.

```mermaid

    A[Global] --> B[Project A];
    A[Global] --> C[Project B];
    A[Global] --> D[...Project N];
```

When you specify the scope in role assignment, please use `global` for global-level scope and `{project name}` for project-level scope.

Feature level access control is **NOT** supported yet. Users are encouraged to group features with similar access control rules in one project.

### Role

A _role_ is a collection of permissions. We have 3 built-in roles with different permissions:
| Role | Description | Permissions |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Admin | The owner of project | Read, Write, Manage |
| Producer | The contributor of project | Read, Write |
| Consumer | The reader of project | Read |

### Permission

_permission_ refers to the a certain kind of access to registry metadata or role assignment records.
| Permission | Description |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read | Read registry meta data; `GET` Registry APIs |
| Write | Write registry meta data; `POST` Registry APIs |
| Manage | Create and manage role assignment records with management APIs |

### User

A _user_ can be an email account or an [Azure AppId](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

All Registry API requests requires `token` in header to identify the requestor and validate the permission.

- Feathr UI uses the id token of login account. User credentials will be auto generated with [@azure/msal-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-browser)
- Feathr Client let users to pass their own credentials.
- In particular, Feathr samples get token with [DefaultAzureCredential()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python).

Please make sure your token is valid when getting `500` or `401` Exceptions.

_AAD Group_ is **NOT** supported yet.

### Role Assignment

A _Role Assignment_ is the process of add a `user-role` mapping record into backend storage table.

[Feature Registry](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/concepts/feature-registry.html#access-control-management-page) section briefly introduced the access control management page, where project admins can manage role assignments.
Management APIs are not exposed in Feathr Client by design. As we don't want to put control plane together with data plane.

## How to enable Registry Access Control?

[Azure Resource Provisioning](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/how-to-guides/azure-deployment-arm.html) section has detailed instructions on resource provisioning. For RBAC specific, you will need to manually:

1. Choose `Yes` for `Enable RBAC` in ARM Template, and provision the resources.
2. Create a `userrole` table in provisioned SQL database with [RBAC Schema](../../registry/access_control/scripts/schema.sql).
3. Initialize the `userrole` table refer to commands in [test data](../../registry/access_control/scripts/test_data.sql).
4. Login to the Web UI and navigate to the management page, and the roles you initialized in #3 should be in table.

For more details, please refer to the [Feathr Registry Access Control Gateway Specifications](../../../feathr/registry/access_control/README.md).
