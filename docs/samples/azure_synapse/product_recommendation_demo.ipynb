        "This notebook demonstrates how Feathr Feature Store can simplify and empower your model training and inference using [Azure Synapse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics/). With this notebook, you will learn the followings:\n",

        "1. Define sharable features using Feathr API\n",
        "2. Register features with register API\n",
        "3. Create a training dataset via point-in-time feature join with Feathr API\n",

        "In this tutorial, we use Feathr Feature Store to create a model that predicts users' product ratings for an e-commerce website. The main purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the capabilities running on Azure Synapse and thus we simplified the problem to just predict the ratings for a single product. An advanced example can be found [here](../product_recommendation_demo_advanced.ipynb)."

Please follow the steps [here](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/how-to-guides/azure-deployment-arm.html) to provision required cloud resources. This will create a new resource group and deploy the needed Azure resources in it. \n",
