The websie also collected data about user and product, like user age, product category etc. Now we want to predict users' product rating for new product so that we can recommend the new product to users that give a high rating for those products.\n","\n","After the model is trained, given a user_id, product_id pair and features, we should be able to predict the product rating that the user will give for this product_id.\n","\n","(Compared with [the beginner version of product recommendation](product_recommendation_demo.ipynb), this tutorial expanded the example by predicting ratings for all products.)\n","\n","## Feature Creation Illustration\n","In this example, our observation data has compound entity key where a record is uniquely identified by user_id and product_id. So there might be 3 types of features:\n","* User features that are different for different users but are the same for different products. For example, user age is different for different users but it's the same for all products(or it's product-agnostic).\n","* Product features that are different for different products but are the same for different users.\n","* User-to-product features that are different for different users AND different products. For example, a feature to represent if the user has bought this product before or not.\n","\n","We will focus on the first two in our example.\n","\n","The feature creation flow is as below:\n","![Feature Flow](https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/blob/main/docs/images/product_recommendation_advanced.jpg?raw=true)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"52b7d651-19d4-44b0-a7a8-03549f49e524","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## Prerequisite: Use Quick Start Template to Provision Azure Resources\n","\n","First step is to provision required cloud resources if you want to use Feathr.
