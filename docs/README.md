## What is Feathr?

Feathr is the feature store that is used in production in LinkedIn for many years and was open sourced in April 2022. It is currently a project under [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2022/09/12/feathr-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-sandbox-project/).

Read our announcement on [Open Sourcing Feathr](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/open-sourcing-feathr---linkedin-s-feature-store-for-productive-m) and [Feathr on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/feathr-linkedin-s-feature-store-is-now-available-on-azure/), as well as the [announcement from LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2022/09/12/feathr-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-sandbox-project/).

Feathr lets you:

- **Define features** based on raw data sources (batch and streaming) using pythonic APIs.
- **Register and get features by names** during model training and model inference.
- **Share features** across your team and company.

Feathr automatically computes your feature values and joins them to your training data, using point-in-time-correct semantics to avoid data leakage, and supports materializing and deploying your features for use online in production.

## üåü Feathr Highlights

- **Battle tested in production for more than 6 years:** LinkedIn has been using Feathr in production for over 6 years and have a dedicated team improving it.
- **Scalable with built-in optimizations:** For example, based on some internal use case, Feathr can process billions of rows and PB scale data with built-in optimizations such as bloom filters and salted joins.
- **Rich support for point-in-time joins and aggregations:** Feathr has high performant built-in operators designed for Feature Store, including time-based aggregation, sliding window joins, look-up features, all with point-in-time correctness.
- **Highly customizable user-defined functions (UDFs)** with native PySpark and Spark SQL support to lower the learning curve for data scientists.
- **Pythonic APIs** to access everything with low learning curve; Integrated with model building so data scientists can be productive from day one.
- **Derived Features** which is a unique capability across all the feature store solutions. This encourage feature consumers to build features on existing features and encouraging feature reuse.
- **Rich type system** including support for embeddings for advanced machine learning/deep learning scenarios. One of the common use cases is to build embeddings for customer profiles, and those embeddings can be reused across an organization in all the machine learning applications.
- **Native cloud integration** with simplified and scalable architecture, which is illustrated in the next section.
- **Feature sharing and reuse made easy:** Feathr has built-in feature registry so that features can be easily shared across different teams and boost team productivity.

## üèÉ Getting Started with Feathr - Feathr Sandbox

The easiest way to try out Feathr is to use the [Feathr Sandbox](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/quickstart_local_sandbox.html) which is a self-contained container with most of Feathr's capabilities and you should be productive in 5 minutes. To use it, simply run this command:

```bash
# 80: Feathr UI, 8888: Jupyter, 7080: Interpret
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 8081:80 -p 7080:7080 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes feathrfeaturestore/feathr-sandbox:releases-v1.0.0
```

And you can view Feathr quickstart jupyter notebook:
```bash
http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-w/tree/local_quickstart_notebook.ipynb
```

After running the notebook, all the features will be registered in the UI, and you can visit the Feathr UI at:

```bash
http://localhost:8081
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Install Feathr Client Locally

If you want to install Feathr client in a python environment, use this:

```bash
pip install feathr
```

Or use the latest code from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr.git#subdirectory=feathr_project
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Running Feathr on Cloud for Production

Feathr has native integrations with Databricks and Azure Synapse:

Follow the [Feathr ARM deployment guide](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/how-to-guides/azure-deployment-arm.html) to run Feathr on Azure. This allows you to quickly get started with automated deployment using Azure Resource Manager template.

If you want to set up everything manually, you can checkout the [Feathr CLI deployment guide](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/how-to-guides/azure-deployment-cli.html) to run Feathr on Azure. This allows you to understand what is going on and set up one resource at a time.

- Please read the [Quick Start Guide for Feathr on Databricks](./quickstart_databricks.md) to run Feathr with Databricks.
- Please read the [Quick Start Guide for Feathr on Azure Synapse](./quickstart_synapse.md) to run Feathr with Azure Synapse.

![Feathr UI](./images/feathr-ui.png)

For more information on the Feathr UI and the registry behind it, please refer to [Feathr Feature Registry](./concepts/feature-registry.md)

### Rich UDF Support

Feathr has highly customizable UDFs with native PySpark and Spark SQL integration to lower learning curve for data scientists:

```python
def add_new_dropoff_and_fare_amount_column(df: DataFrame):
    df = df.withColumn("f_day_of_week", dayofweek("lpep_dropoff_datetime"))
    df = df.withColumn("fare_amount_cents", df.fare_amount.cast('double') * 100)
    return df

batch_source = HdfsSource(name="nycTaxiBatchSource",
                        path="abfss://feathrazuretest3fs@feathrazuretest3storage.dfs.core.windows.net/demo_data/green_tripdata_2020-04.csv",
                        preprocessing=add_new_dropoff_and_fare_amount_column,
                        event_timestamp_column="new_lpep_dropoff_datetime",
                        timestamp_format="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
```

### Defining Window Aggregation Features with Point-in-time correctness

```python
agg_features = [Feature(name="f_location_avg_fare",
                        key=location_id,                          # Query/join key of the feature(group)
                        feature_type=FLOAT,
                        transform=WindowAggTransformation(        # Window Aggregation transformation
                            agg_expr="cast_float(fare_amount)",
                            agg_func="AVG",                       # Apply average aggregation over the window
                            window="90d")),                       # Over a 90-day window
                ]

agg_anchor = FeatureAnchor(name="aggregationFeatures",
                           source=batch_source,
                           features=agg_features)
```

### Define features on top of other features - Derived Features

```python
# Compute a new feature(a.k.a. derived feature) on top of an existing feature
derived_feature = DerivedFeature(name="f_trip_time_distance",
                                 feature_type=FLOAT,
                                 key=trip_key,
                                 input_features=[f_trip_distance, f_trip_time_duration],
                                 transform="f_trip_distance * f_trip_time_duration")

# Another example to compute embedding similarity
user_embedding = Feature(name="user_embedding", feature_type=DENSE_VECTOR, key=user_key)
item_embedding = Feature(name="item_embedding", feature_type=DENSE_VECTOR, key=item_key)

user_item_similarity = DerivedFeature(name="user_item_similarity",
                                      feature_type=FLOAT,
                                      key=[user_key, item_key],
                                      input_features=[user_embedding, item_embedding],
                                      transform="cosine_similarity(user_embedding, item_embedding)")
```

### Define Streaming Features
