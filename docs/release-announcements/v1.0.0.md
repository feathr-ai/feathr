Announce Feathr 1.0.0

Feathr 1.0.0-rc1 is released on February 16, 2023 with following new features

New Features:

- Feathr sandbox: The Feathr sandbox is a pre-configured environment that you can use to learn how to use Feathr, experiment with features, and build proof-of-concept applications locally, without setting up complex infrastructure on the cloud. Please check out [Quick Start Guide with Local Sandbox](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/quickstart_local_sandbox.html) to get started.

- Online Transform: Online Transform is a feature that enables real-time feature transformations as part of the feature retrieval process, here are some use cases examples:

  - Featurization source is only available at inference time​.

  - Using offline transform might be a waste of storage and compute resources.
  - Users would like to decouple featurization work off up-stream online system.
  - Users would like to define transformation once for both online and offline consumption.  
  Please checkout [feathr-ai/feathr-online (github.com)](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr-online#readme) to get started

- Use Azure Cosmos DB as online store. Please see following documentation for provisioning and materialization
  
  - Provisioning: [Azure Resource Provisioning through Azure Resource Manager](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/how-to-guides/azure-deployment-arm.html#azure-resource-provisioning)
  
  - Materialization: [Using SQL databases, CosmosDb with Feathr](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/how-to-guides/jdbc-cosmos-notes.html#using-cosmosdb-as-the-online-store)

- Feathr Notebook samples now provide 5 getting started tutorial with Jupyter notebooks to help users get started, these notebooks cover various use cases commonly used in ML work.
