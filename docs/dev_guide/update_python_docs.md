# Developer Guide for updating python SDK docs

## Install Dependencis

`pip install sphinx &&  pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`

Since `sphinx` need to run the source code to generate the documentation, make sure you have installed the all the necessary dependencies needed by the project(see setup.py files).

## Update the documentation html files

After you updated the documentation in the source code, run the following command to update the html files.

In docs directory:

`sphinx-apidoc -f -o . ../feathr ../*setup*`

(excluding setup.py files and some other demo files, test files.)

Then rebuild the html files:

`make clean && make html`

You will see new html files generated under `_build/html/` directory and you can view `_build/html/index.html` in your browser locally.

## Upload to Readthedocs.com

(TBD)
