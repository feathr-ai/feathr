# Feature Data Maintenence API
Other than providing APIs used to ingest feature data for model training and inference, we also provide APIs for feature data maintenence, like deletion, retention, and query.

(Some of these APIs are still work-in-progress)

# Offline
## Offline Feature Data Deletion API(WIP)
This API allows you to delete feature data by entity key when given a offline storage path.

## Offline Feature Data Query API(WIP)
This API allows you to query feature data by entity key(s) when given feature name.

# Online
## Online Feature Data Deletion API(WIP)
This API allows you to delete feature data by entity key from a online storage.
* For Redis: https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/issues/161

## Online Feature Data Rention(WIP)
This API/configuration allows you to set rention time for the feature data.
