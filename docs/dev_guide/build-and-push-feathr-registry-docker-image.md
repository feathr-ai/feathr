# How to build and push feathr registry docker image

This doc shows how to build feathr registry docker image locally and publish to DockerHub.

## Prerequisites

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) to setup docker locally.

## Build docker image locally

Open terminal and go to root of this repository, run following command:

```bash
docker build -f FeathrRegistry.Dockerfile -t feathrfeaturestore/feathr-registry .
```

## Test docker image locally

Run **docker images** command, you will see newly created image listed in output.

```bash
docker images
```

Run **docker run** command to test docker image locally.

### Test SQL-based registry

You need to setup the connection string `CONNECTION_STR` for the docker container, so that it knows which SQL-based registry is connected to. The connection string will be something like this:

```bash
"Server=tcp:testregistry.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=testsql;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=feathr@feathrtestsql;Password=StrongPassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
```

Then you can test the docker locally by running this command:

```bash
docker run --env CONNECTION_STR=<REPLACE_ME> --env API_BASE=api/v1 -it --rm -p 3000:80 feathrfeaturestore/sql-registry
```

### Test Purview registry

You need to setup a few environment variables, include:

- `PURVIEW_NAME` indicates the Purview service name
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` indicates the service principal account to talk with Purview service.

```bash
docker run --env PURVIEW_NAME=<REPLACE_ME> --env AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<REPLACE_ME> --env AZURE_TENANT_ID=<REPLACE_ME> --env AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<REPLACE_ME> --env API_BASE=api/v1  -it --rm -p 3000:80 feathrfeaturestore/feathr-registry
```

### Test SQL registry + RBAC

```bash
docker run --env REACT_APP_ENABLE_RBAC=true --env REACT_APP_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<REPLACE_ME> --env REACT_APP_AZURE_TENANT_ID=<REPLACE_ME> --env CONNECTION_STR=<REPLACE_ME> --env API_BASE=api/v1 -it --rm -p 3000:80 feathrfeaturestore/feathr-registry
```

After docker image launched, open web browser and navigate to <https://localhost:3000>ï¼Œverify both the Feathr UI and the registry backend (SQL/Purview) can work correctly.

## Upload to DockerHub (For Feathr Release Manager)

The Feathr repository already have automatic CD pipelines to publish the docker image to DockerHub on release branches. Please checkout [docker publish workflow](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) for details

In case if the Feathr release manager wants to do it manually, login with feathrfeaturestore account and then run **docker push** command to publish docker image to DockerHub. Contact Feathr Team (@jainr, @blrchen) for credentials.

```bash
docker login
docker push feathrfeaturestore/feathr-registry
```

## Published Feathr Registry Image

The published feathr feature registry is located in [DockerHub here](https://hub.docker.com/r/feathrfeaturestore/feathr-registry).
