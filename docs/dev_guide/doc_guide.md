# Documentation Guideline

We prefer simplicity and currently use GitHub page to host the Feathr user documentation. Those documentation will be built automatically by GitHub pipelines in the main branch.

## Hierarchy

In order for your docs to be rendered properly in the documentation hierarchy, Feathr developers need to add the section below at the top of each documentation. The `title` section will be what end user actually see in the side bar, and the `parent` section represents the parent page of the current page for linking purpose.
