## Code Changes
Before the release is made, the version needs to be updated in following places

## Triggering automated release pipelines
Our goal is to automate the release process as much as possible. So far, we have automated the following steps
1. Automated [workflow](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) to build and publish for our UI and API container to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/feathrfeaturestore/feathr-registry/tags).
    **Triggers** - Nightly, branch with name pattern "releases/*"

1. Automated [workflow](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml) for publishing Python package to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/feathr/).

    **Triggers** -  branch with name pattern "releases/*"

1. Automated Maven workflow - Coming soon.

**PLEASE NOTE: To trigger the above workflows as part of release, create a new branch with pattern releases/v0.x.0**. See past release branches [here](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/branches/all?query=releases).


## Release Maven

See [Developer Guide for publishing to maven](publish_to_maven.md)

## Upload Feathr Jar

Run the command to generate the Java jar. After the jar is generated, please upload to [Azure storage](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Storage/ContainerMenuBlade/~/overview/storageAccountId/%2Fsubscriptions%2Fa6c2a7cc-d67e-4a1a-b765-983f08c0423a%2FresourceGroups%2Fazurefeathrintegration%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Storage%2FstorageAccounts%2Fazurefeathrstorage/path/public/etag/%220x8D9E6F64D62D599%22/defaultEncryptionScope/%24account-encryption-key/denyEncryptionScopeOverride//defaultId//publicAccessVal/Container) for faster access.

## Release PyPi
The automated workflow should take care of this, you can check under [actions](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml) to see the triggered run and results. For manual steps, see [Python Package Release Note](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/dev_guide/python_package_release.html)

## Updating docker image for API and Registry
The automated workflow should take care of this as well, you can check under [actions](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml) to see the triggered run and results. For manual steps, see [Feathr Registry docker image](https://feathr-ai.github.io/feathr/dev_guide/build-and-push-feathr-registry-docker-image.html)

## Testing
Run one of the sample [notebook](https://github.com/feathr-ai/feathr/blob/main/docs/samples/product_recommendation_demo.ipynb) as it uses the latest package from Maven and PyPi.

## Announcement

Please announce the release in our #general Slack channel.
