# Configuration and environment variables in Feathr

Feathr uses a YAML file and a few environment variables to allow end users to have more flexibility. See the example of the following configurations in [this file](https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/blob/main/feathr_project/feathrcli/data/feathr_user_workspace/feathr_config.yaml).

In that YAML file, it contains the configurations that are used by Feathr. All the configurations can be overwritten by environment variables with concatenation of `__` for different layers of this config file. For example, `feathr_runtime_location` for databricks can be overwritten by setting this environment variable: `SPARK_CONFIG__DATABRICKS__FEATHR_RUNTIME_LOCATION`. For example, you can set it in python:

```python
os.environ['SPARK_CONFIG__DATABRICKS__FEATHR_RUNTIME_LOCATION'] = "https://azurefeathrstorage.blob.core.windows.net/public/feathr-assembly-LATEST.jar"
```

or in shell environment:

```bash
export SPARK_CONFIG__DATABRICKS__FEATHR_RUNTIME_LOCATION=https://azurefeathrstorage.blob.core.windows.net/public/feathr-assembly-LATEST.jar
```

This allows end users to store the configuration in a secure way, say in Kubernetes secrets, key vault, etc. All the configurations available for end users to configure are listed below.

# Default behaviors

Feathr will get the configurations in the following order:

1. If the key is set in the environment variable, Feathr will use the value of that environment variable
2. If it's not set in the environment, then a value is retrieved from the feathr_config.yaml file with the same config key.
3. If it's not available in the feathr_config.yaml file, Feathr will try to retrieve the value from a key vault service. Currently only Azure Key Vault is supported.

# Explanation for selected configurations

## KAFKA_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG

Feathr uses Kafka behind the scene for streaming input, and Kafka uses the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) for SASL ([Simple Authentication and Security Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer)) configuration. You must provide JAAS configurations for all SASL authentication. 

For cloud services such as Azure EventHub or AWS Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK), they usually use `ConnectionString` as user name, and the password will be the exact content of the connection string. Feathr will automatically fill that part in so you don't have to worry about it.

In order to get the exact value of the `password` part (i.e. connection string), you can retrieve it from the Azure portal like below:

![EventHub Config](../images/eventhub_config.png)

For Azure EventHub, read [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka#updating-your-kafka-client-configuration) for how to get this string from the existing string in Azure Portal. The value will be something like:  `Endpoint=sb://feathrazureci.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=feathrcipolicy;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaa=;EntityPath=feathrcieventhub`, and note that you don't need the `EntityPath=feathrcieventhub` part, as this represents the Kafka topic, which you will specify in the code in other places. 

So finally the configuration in Python will be something like:

```python
os.environ['KAFKA_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG'] = 'Endpoint=sb://feathrazureci.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=feathrcipolicy;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaa='
```

## SPARK_CONFIG__DATABRICKS__CONFIG_TEMPLATE

Essentially it's a compact JSON string represents the important configurations that you can configure for the databricks cluster that you use. There are parts that marked as "FEATHR_FILL_IN" that Feathr will fill in, but all the other parts are customizable.

Essentially, the config template represents what is going to be submitted to a databricks cluster, and you can see the structure of this configuration template by visiting the [Databricks job runs API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/2.0/jobs#--runs-submit):

The most important and useful part would be the `new_cluster` section. For example, you can change`spark_version`, `node_type_id`, `num_workers`, etc. based on your environment.

```json
{"run_name":"FEATHR_FILL_IN","new_cluster":{"spark_version":"9.1.x-scala2.12","node_type_id":"Standard_D3_v2","num_workers":2,"spark_conf":{"FEATHR_FILL_IN":"FEATHR_FILL_IN"}},"libraries":[{"jar":"FEATHR_FILL_IN"}],"spark_jar_task":{"main_class_name":"FEATHR_FILL_IN","parameters":["FEATHR_FILL_IN"]}}
```

Another use case is to use `instance_pool_id`, where instead of creating the Spark cluster from scratch every time, you can reuse a pool to run the job to make the run time shorter:

```json
{"run_name":"FEATHR_FILL_IN","new_cluster":{"spark_version":"9.1.x-scala2.12","num_workers":2,"spark_conf":{"FEATHR_FILL_IN":"FEATHR_FILL_IN"},"instance_pool_id":"0403-214809-inlet434-pool-l9dj3kwz"},"libraries":[{"jar":"FEATHR_FILL_IN"}],"spark_jar_task":{"main_class_name":"FEATHR_FILL_IN","parameters":["FEATHR_FILL_IN"]}}

```

Other advanced settings includes `idempotency_token` to guarantee the idempotency of job run requests, etc.

## FEATURE_REGISTRY__PURVIEW__DELIMITER

Delimiter indicates that how the project name, feature names etc. are delimited. By default it will be '__'. this is for global reference (mainly for feature sharing). For example, when we setup a project called foo, and we have an anchor called 'taxi_driver' and the feature name is called 'f_daily_trips'. the feature will have a global unique name called 'foo__taxi_driver__f_daily_trips'

# A note on using Azure Key Vault to store credentials

Feathr has native integrations with Azure Key Vault to make it more secure to access resources. However, Azure Key Vault doesn't support the secret name to have underscore `_` in the secret name. Feathr will automatically convert underscore `_` to dash `-`. For example, Feathr will look for `ONLINE-STORE--REDIS--HOST` in Azure Key Vault if the actual environment variable is `ONLINE_STORE__REDIS__HOST`.

Please refer to [akv_client.py](https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/blob/main/feathr_project/feathr/secrets/akv_client.py) to understand the secret name convert logic.

Azure Key Vault is not case sensitive, so `online_store__redis__host` and `ONLINE_STORE__REDIS__HOST` will result in the same request to Azure Key Vault and yield the same result.

You can automatically store resource credentials in provision stage, just like [azure_resource_provision.json](https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/blob/main/docs/how-to-guides/azure_resource_provision.json) do for `REDIS-PASSWORD`.
