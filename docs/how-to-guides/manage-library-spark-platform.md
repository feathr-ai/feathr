# Manage libraries for Azure Synapse

Sometimes you might run into dependency issues where a particular dependency might be missing on your spark compute, most likely you will face this issue while executing sample notebooks in that environment.

If you want to intall maven, PyPi or private packages on your Synapse cluster, you can follow the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-azure-portal-add-libraries) of how to do it for workspace, pool and session and the difference between each one of them.


## Manage libraries for Azure Databricks

Similarly to install an external library from PyPi, Maven or private packages, you can follow the official [databricks documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/cluster-libraries)
