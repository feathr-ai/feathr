   * Notes about the dependency graph for key-tagged features (different from the dependency graph for untagged features)
   *
   * A Key-tagged feature (aka subject-ascribed feature) is like viewer:a_x or viewee:a_x,
   * while a "raw" untagged feature is something like just plain a_x.
   *
   * A Derived feature (such as "the difference between viewer's and viewee's connection count") might depend on a single
   * raw feature (a's connection count) but more than one tagged-feature (viewer:a_x and viewee:)
   *
   * Assume A is anchored.
   *
   *     x:A                  y:A

   *           (x,y):D
   * Note: in the implementation, x and y are actually integers, e.g, use (0,1) to represent (viewerid, vieweeid)
   * Feature Graph (resolve for D):
   * D -> B, C
   * C -> A
   * B -> A
   * Ordered Plan: [A], [B, C, D]    (Note: currently plan is consist of two parts, first [] contains anchored feature (A),
   * second [] contains derived feature B,C,D. features in same [] are calculated in sequential order
   * However, ideally, this could be represented as [A], [B,C], [D], where features in same [] can
   * be calculated in parallel, features in different [] should be calculated in sequential order,
   * or even better, record all dependencies, but make no sequential order representation, a feature
   * begin to calculate whenever all dependencies are met.
   *
   * Subject-Feature Graph (resolve for `(x,y):D`): (resolve happens in a bottom-up manner, as bottom-features are the required features)
   * (x,y):D -> x:C, y:B
   * x:C -> x:A
   * y:B -> y:A
   * Ordered Plan: [x:A, y:A], [y:B, x:C, (x,y):D]
   * "Join A for key `x` and join A for key `y`. Then compute these derived features in this order."
   *
   * Note: "Feature Dump" isn't possible here in general cases. You need ids for the join, right?
   * We could probably support feature dump for single-key cases.
   *
   *
   * Furthermore: Need to be careful about whether different anchors come from the same source.
