    "# Feathr Feature Store on Azure Demo Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of Feature Store to create a model that predicts NYC Taxi fares. It includes these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the key capabilities of Feathr, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install and set up Feathr with Azure\n",
    "2. Create shareable features with Feathr feature definition configs.\n",
    "3. Create a training dataset via point-in-time feature join.\n",
    "4. Compute and write features.\n",
    "5. Train a model using these features to predict fares.\n",
    "6. Materialize feature value to online store.\n",
    "7. Fetch feature value in real-time from online store for online scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use Feathr Feature Store to create a model that predicts NYC Yellow Taxi fares. The dataset comes from [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The feature flow is as below:\n",

    "## Prerequisite: Provision cloud resources\n",
    "\n",
    "First step is to provision required cloud resources if you want to use Feathr. Feathr provides a python based client to interact with cloud resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the steps [here]() to provision required cloud resources. Due to the complexity of the possible cloud environment, it is almost impossible to create a script that works for all the use cases. Because of this, [azure_resource_provision.sh](https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/blob/main/docs/how-to-guides/azure_resource_provision.sh) is a full end to end command line to create all the required resources, and you can tailor the script as needed, while [the companion documentation](https://github.com/linkedin/feathr/blob/main/docs/how-to-guides/azure-deployment.md) can be used as a complete guide for using that shell script.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the script, it should give you some output which you will need later. For example, the Service Principal IDs, Redis endpoint, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also note that at the end of this step, you need to **manually** grant your service principal \"Data Curator\" permission of your Azure Purview account, due to a current limiation with Azure Purview.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the architecture is as below:\n",
