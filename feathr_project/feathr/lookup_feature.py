    """A lookup feature is a feature defined on top of two other features, i.e. using the feature value
    of the base feature as key, to lookup the feature value from the expansion feature.
    e.g. a lookup feature user_purchased_item_avg_price could be key-ed by user_id, and computed by:
        base feature is user_purchased_item_ids. For a given user_id, it returns the item ids purchased by the user.
        expansion feature is item_price. For a given item id, it returns the item price.
