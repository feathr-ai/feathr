# Contribution Process

The Feathr community welcome everyone, and encourage a friendly and positive environment.

**Contributions of various forms are welcome!**

Please read existing Github issues or development work that is in progress or in the backlog to avoid duplication. If you are interested in those existing ones, you can leave a comment in the Github issues and the community will try to involve you. If you are not sure if it's duplicated, just create a Github issue and ask!

If it's a simple bug fix(less than 20 lines) or documentation change, you can just submit your pull request(PR) without Github issues. For any other PRs, a Github issue is required.

If you want to contribute something new and it's not tracked in existing Github issues, please create a new Github issue and the community will help review the idea. Please state `why` in your Github issue. If you already have a short design in mind, you can provide a one pager in the Github issue. If the idea in general make sense, then we can proceed to the design or development work. If the change is not small, an [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) should be reviewed and approved by the team.

If you have any feature request, please create a new Github issue and the community will collect your feature request and work on it.

If you have any user feedback, please create a new Github issue and the community will collect your feedback and work on it.

# Code Of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.
Our open source community strives to:

- **Be friendly and patient**: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- **Be welcoming**: Our community welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be respectful**: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
- **Understand disagreements**: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
- **Remember that we’re different**. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
